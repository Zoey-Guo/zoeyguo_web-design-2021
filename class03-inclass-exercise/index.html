		<p>A prince am I of ancestry renowned,
		When Sirius did in spring its light display,
		A child was born, and Tiger marked the day. When first upon my face my lord's eye glanced,
For me auspicious names he straight advanced,
Denoting that in me Heaven's marks divine
Should with the virtues of the earth combine.</p>
